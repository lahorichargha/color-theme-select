<span class="org-level-2">** Luke, Use the Source</span>

Code for this site is located at <a href="http://github.com/vic/color-theme-select" class="org-link">http://github.com/vic/color-theme-select</a> 

<span class="org-level-2">** Devel Roadmap</span>

An overview of how to develop this site and tools available in the 
source code repository.

If all you need to know is how to dump an existing color-theme to 
json format for inclusion in this site, skip to the section:
              "Dumping your theme to JSON" 

<span class="org-level-3">*** How Things work</span>

Everything starts with existing color-themes .el files.

<span class="org-level-4">**** Tools</span>

The source distribution includes tools for dumping those emacs lisp
files into json format that is more suitable for this site runtime.
Most of the hard work is done with json.el and color-theme.el itself.

The site-lisp/dump-theme.el file is responsable for dumping existing
color themes to json format. A thin shell wrapper bin/dump-theme.sh 
provides comments on how to use it from the command line.

There's also a site-lisp/dump-light.el that can be used to generate
a theme for light/dark backgrounds without any theme customization.
The bin/dump-light.sh utility is used to generate the default 
            color-theme-light, color-theme-dark 
themes used as default ones this site.

Tools used to build this project include <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/" class="org-link">emacs</a>, <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/" class="org-link">rake</a>, <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/" class="org-link">rhino</a>

<span class="org-level-4">**** Coffee </span>

The core behind this site is just a set of javascript libraries 
mostly coded in <a href="http://jashkenas.github.com/coffee-script/" class="org-link">coffeescript</a> and located in the coffee/ directory
on the source distribution.

This site uses <a href="http://requirejs.org/" class="org-link">requirejs</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/" class="org-link">less</a>, <a href="http://jquery.org" class="org-link">jquery</a>, <a href="http://www.eyecon.ro/colorpicker/" class="org-link">colorpicker</a>, and a 
catalog of colors from <a href="http://www.colorjack.com/labs/galaxy/" class="org-link">Color Galaxy</a>.

<span class="org-level-4">**** Htmlized Files</span>

Example files like this were written in the corresponding major mode
and then htmlized with the <span class="org-link">htmlize-buffer</span> function, only the html 
inside the &lt;pre&gt; tag is saved under a file in public/files/.
These htmlized files dont include css styling, because that will be
loaded dynamically by this site according to the selected theme.
The public/files.json file describes the tree to build the speedbar.


<span class="org-level-2">** Dumping your theme to JSON</span>

You don't need to checkout all the source just to dump your current
lovely color theme to JSON.

Just download this file:

<a href="http://github.com/vic/color-theme-select/raw/master/site-lisp/dump-theme.el" class="org-link">http://github.com/vic/color-theme-select/raw/master/site-lisp/dump-theme.el</a>

And execute the following command line: 

    env DUMP_THEME_JSON=my-theme.json \
    emacs --no-init-file --no-site-file -f toggle-debug-on-error \
    -l dump-theme.el -l my-theme.el -f my-theme -f kill-emacs

Just replace my-theme.json by the output file you want, my-theme.el
by the emacs lisp source where your theme is included and my-theme
by the function name used to install your theme.
