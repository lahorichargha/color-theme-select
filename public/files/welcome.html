<span class="info-menu-header">* Usage:</span>
<div>
  As you can see, this site's GUI mimics an emacs window showing four buffers:<br/>

  <span class="info-menu-star">*</span> <span class="info-xref">Color Theme Selection</span> The upper right buffer lists known color themes.<br/>
  * <span class="info-xref">Customize Face</span> The upper left buffer for customizing most face attributes.<br />
  * <span class="info-xref">Speedbar</span> Shows a list of htmlized files intended for theme preview.<br />
  * <span class="info-xref">Mode Preview</span> Holds content for htmlized files.<br />
  <br />
   Click on any name from the <span class="info-xref">Color Theme Selection</span> buffer. Once loaded, you can customize every face defined by the theme in the <span class="info-xref">Customize Face</span> buffer. 
   Open some files from the <span class="info-xref">Speedbar</span> buffer to see how they would look with your current theme.<br />

  <br />
   When you are happy with your settings, set a name for your theme in the minibuffer prompt, click the Save button and install it on your
   .emacs file. 
  <br/>
  <br />
   This site generates a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permalink">permalink</a> for each theme you save, allowing you to share them with friends and contribute them for being listed here.
   <br />
   <br />
   Themes are saved as <a target="_blank" href="http://gist.github.com">gists</a> which means they can be reloaded at any time, just give the gist-id to this site after the hash like this: <span id="location"></span>#GIST

  <script type="text/javascript">
    _.defer(function(){
       $('span#location').text(location.protocol+'//'+location.host+location.pathname)
    });
  </script>

</div>
